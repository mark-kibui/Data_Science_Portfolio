## Featured Projects

### [1. Spotify Music Recommendation System](https://github.com/mark-kibui/Spotify_Data.git)  
Spotify Music Trends Analysis
Explored Spotify's Million Songs dataset to uncover insights into the music industry's evolution. The project focused on analyzing audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and popularity across different genres and years.

**Key Features:**

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in music preferences over time.
Developed visualizations to show how genres evolve and how song features relate to popularity.
Utilized interactive plots for dynamic insights into music trends.

### [2. Belgian House Prediction](https://github.com/mark-kibui/Predict-House-Prices.git)
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict house prices in the Belgian housing market. The goal was to provide insights for buyers and sellers to optimize pricing strategies.

- **Key Features:**
- Data Exploration & Feature Engineering: Analyzed key features like house area, location, and construction year.
- Modeling: Compared Random Forest and XGBoost models. Random Forest achieved the best performance with an R² score of 0.89 and MAE of 23,544.41.
- Business Value: The model helps real estate agents and investors make data-driven decisions by identifying key factors that influence property prices. 
- **Technologies Used:**  Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

### [4. RNN Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/mark-kibui/Phase-4-Project)  
Collaborated on a project to leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for identifying pneumonia in medical imaging datasets.  

- **Key Features:**  
  - Preprocessed medical imaging data for deep learning pipelines
  - The performance is as follows:
      - Validation Loss: 0.2682477533817291
      - -Validation Accuracy: 0.875
      - -Test Loss: 0.23323379456996918
      - -Test Accuracy: 0.9150640964508057

The validation accuracy of 0.87 performed better and ResNet50V2 proved to be better for identify pneumonia.  
  - Developed a robust classification model for healthcare applications  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow

### [3. Bank_Customer_Segmentation](https://github.com/mark-kibui/Bank-Customer-Segmentation.git)
Segment bank customers into distinct groups to help the bank tailor marketing strategies, products, and services effectively.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Preprocessed customer demographic and behavioral data:
    - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
  - Engineered features such as customer age,.  
  - Performed K-means clustering:
    - Determined 6 optimal clusters using the Elbow method.
    - Conducted silhouette analysis with an average silhouette score of 0.41.
    - Identified clusters with distinct spending habits and engagement levels.
    - Highlighted outlier clusters representing unique customer behaviors.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
