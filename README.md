    * Diploma in Civil Engineering, The Technical University of Kenya (2014 - 2017)
    * Data Science Program, Moringa School (August 2023 - May 2024)
* **Location:** Nairobi, Kenya
* **Interests:** Data science in construction, recommendation systems, and solving African-specific challenges with data.

**Skills**

* **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, R
* **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Annoy
* **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, Clustering, Random Forests, Neural Networks, RNNs
* **Other Expertise:** Data visualization, ETL processes, exploratory data analysis (EDA)

**Featured Projects**

**1. Spotify Music Recommendation System**

A recommendation system built with Python, Annoy, Pandas, and NumPy to suggest music based on user preferences. It leverages the Spotify 1 Million Songs dataset for training.

* **Key Features:**
    * Encoded audio features and genre data for improved accuracy
    * Model optimizations for user-specific recommendations

**2. Hard Hat Classification Model**

A safety recognition model classifying images annotated in COCO format to detect compliance with wearing hard hats. This Python-based project utilizes TensorFlow for model training.

* **Key Features:**
    * Trained using TensorFlow for image recognition
    * Processes annotations in COCO JSON format for input preprocessing

**3. Diabetes Readmission Prediction**

Using patient medical data, this project utilizes Python and Scikit-learn to predict hospital readmissions. It employs detailed feature encoding for medications and diagnoses.

* **Key Features:**
    * Ordinal encoding for target and categorical columns
    * Feature engineering for medication trends

**4. RNN Pneumonia Detection**

This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify pneumonia in medical imaging datasets. Implemented in Python with TensorFlow, the model includes:

* **Key Features:**
    * Preprocessed medical imaging data for deep learning pipelines
    * Experimentation with time-series modeling approaches
