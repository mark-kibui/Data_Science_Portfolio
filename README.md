**Featured Projects**

**1. Spotify Music Recommendation System**

A recommendation system built with Python, Annoy, Pandas, and NumPy to suggest music based on user preferences. It leverages the Spotify 1 Million Songs dataset for training.

* **Key Features:**
    * Encoded audio features and genre data for improved accuracy
    * Model optimizations for user-specific recommendations

**2. Hard Hat Classification Model**

A safety recognition model classifying images annotated in COCO format to detect compliance with wearing hard hats. This Python-based project utilizes TensorFlow for model training.

* **Key Features:**
    * Trained using TensorFlow for image recognition
    * Processes annotations in COCO JSON format for input preprocessing

**3. Diabetes Readmission Prediction**

Using patient medical data, this project utilizes Python and Scikit-learn to predict hospital readmissions. It employs detailed feature encoding for medications and diagnoses.

* **Key Features:**
    * Ordinal encoding for target and categorical columns
    * Feature engineering for medication trends

**4. RNN Pneumonia Detection**

This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify pneumonia in medical imaging datasets. Implemented in Python with TensorFlow, the model includes:

* **Key Features:**
    * Preprocessed medical imaging data for deep learning pipelines
